Coleco ADAM Dynomite II Sound Digitizer Cartridge

The Coleco ADAM Dynomite II SDC is a replacement for the rare TriSyd Video Games Dynomite Sound Digitizer cartridge that works with the TriSyd Dynomite Sound
Digitizer software available at http://adamarchive.org/archive/Adam/Drivers/EOS/Dynomite%20Sound%20Digitizer%20%281990%29%20%28Trisyd%20Video%20Games%29.dsk.

As I don't own an original TriSyd Dynomite cartridge and have never seen the circuit used this is not an exact clone of the original but rather a best guess
of how it was designed. This design is based off the Open Amiga Sampler found here https://github.com/echolevel/open-amiga-sampler and modified to work as a
Colecovision cartridge and with the original software.

Prototype testing has been completed and the new Dynomite II works with the original software.

I will be updating the design of the Dynomite II based on testing and recommendations from John Lundy to improve sound quality.  Thanks John!

I will be temporarily removing the v5 Gerbers until I can upload the revised version.

I used my worst Colecovision cartridge to mount the required RCA jacks and potentiometer. John Lundy was kind enough to provide a 3D printable cartridge
design for this project so hopefully in the future no additional original Colecovision cartridges will need to be sacrificed. The STL file is located in
the "Cartridge" folder in this project.

The ADAM DSK image file /Media/Dynomite Sound Digitizer.dsk is a hacked version of the original TriSyd software with a new title screen and intro sound file
that was recorded and then digitized with the Dynomite II SDC. Other than that the software is the same.
