Coleco ADAM Dynomite II Sound Digitizer Cartridge

The Coleco ADAM Dynomite II SDC is a replacement for the rare TriSyd Video Games Dynomite Sound Digitizer cartridge that works with the TriSyd Dynomite Sound
Digitizer software available at http://adamarchive.org/archive/Adam/Drivers/EOS/Dynomite%20Sound%20Digitizer%20%281990%29%20%28Trisyd%20Video%20Games%29.dsk.

As I don't own an original TriSyd Dynomite cartridge and have never seen the circuit used this is not an exact clone of the original but rather a best guess
of how it was designed. This design is based off the Open Amiga Sampler found here https://github.com/echolevel/open-amiga-sampler and modified to work as a
Colecovision cartridge and with the original software.

Prototype testing has been completed and the new Dynomite II works with the original software. I am currently working on the version 1.0 PCB which has some
dimension corrections to fit properly in a standard Colecovision cartridge.

Updates will be posted to this repository as available. These will eventually include tested Gerber files for download and fabrication at your favorite PCB
manufacturing company and a complete Bill of Materials required to build the cartridge for DIYers.
